# ðŸ¤– Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication Explained

## What is A2A Communication?

Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication is when two AI agents communicate directly with each other to negotiate, exchange information, and make decisions on behalf of users. In our system, **PersonalBot** and **TATA AIG Bot** communicate in real-time to get you the best insurance deals.

3. **A2A Trigger**: PersonalBot determines negotiation is needed
4. **Real-time Steps Shown**:
   - "Analyzing car insurance requirements..."
   - "Reviewing TATA AIG policy options..."
   - "Calculating personalized premium rates..."

5. **TATA AIG Bot**: Uses AI + real market data to create offer
6. **Result**: Personalized quote with premium, coverage, features

### **Stage 2: Payment Setup A2A**
```
Accept Offer â†’ PersonalBot â†’ A2A Communication â†’ TATA AIG Bot â†’ Payment Portal
```

6. **Result**: Payment modal with real transaction data

### **Stage 3: Policy Generation A2A**
```
Payment Complete â†’ PersonalBot â†’ A2A Communication â†’ TATA AIG Bot â†’ Policy Documents
```

**What Happens:**
1. **User**: Completes payment
2. **PersonalBot**: "Payment processed! Generating policy documents..."
3. **A2A Trigger**: Policy generation negotiation begins
4. **Real-time Steps Shown**:
   - "PersonalBot initiating policy generation with TATA AIG..."
